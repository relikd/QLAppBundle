QLAppBundle
===========

A QuickLook plugin for app bundles (`.ipa`, `.appex`, `.xcarchive`).

## Why?

I have been using [ProvisionQL][1].
In fact, I have contributed a lot of time and effort into a [pull request][2] to improve features and fix bugs.
But my PR is still open after 1 Â½ years and there is still no support for macOS 15.
I know the author is working on it but it still takes too long for me.
So here it goes, my own fork to maintain.

This is not to devalue the original code, I highly respect the authors contribution for the general public.
I merely want things to be done.
Also, I've removed support for provisioning profiles (`.mobileprovision`, `.provisionprofile`) to focus on app bundles.


## ToDO

- [ ] support for `.apk` files


## Development notes

If you encounter compile errors like:

```
Command SwiftEmitModule failed with a nonzero exit code
```

or

```
Could not build Objective-C module 'ExtensionFoundation'
```

remove the `SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` attribute from Project > Build Settings then try to compile again (it will fail).
Afterwards, restore the value in the attribute.
Now, the build index should be up-to-date and the app should compile fine.

I havent figured out the exact issue, consider it a workaround.
It should only be necessary once (or if you delete your `DerivedData` folder).
